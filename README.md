# üß™ Container Lab Scripts for Network and Cloud Automation

## üåü Project Overview
This repository serves as a centralized collection of container-based lab environments and automation scripts, primarily focused on **[Vendor/Technology Focus - e.g., Network Automation, Cloud Native Networking]**.

The goal is to provide **reproducible**, self-contained environments for learning and testing network configurations, deployment tools, and vendor features using tools like **[Container Tool - e.g., containerlab, Docker Compose]**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run these labs locally, you need the following installed on your system (Linux/macOS recommended):

* **Docker:** (Engine or Desktop)
* **[Container Tool 1 - e.g., containerlab]**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://containerlab.dev/install/).
* **[Container Tool 2 - e.g., Docker Compose]**: (If using Docker Compose for any labs)
* **Python 3.x** and **pip** (For automation/testing scripts in the `scripts/` folder).

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The core of the repository is organized by lab topic in the `labs/` directory:

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `labs/` | **Main Lab Environments.** Each subdirectory is a self-contained lab. |
| `scripts/` | Reusable utility/helper scripts (e.g., lab cleanup, connectivity tests). |
| `configs/` | Centralized initial config snippets used across multiple labs (optional). |
| `images/` | Any custom Dockerfiles or local images used in labs (optional). |

## üöÄ How to Run a Lab (Quick Start)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/container-lab-scripts.git](https://github.com/your-username/container-lab-scripts.git)
    cd container-lab-scripts
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific lab:**
    ```bash
    cd labs/01-basic-ospf-lab
    ```

3.  **Deploy the lab environment:**
    ```bash
    # For containerlab topologies
    sudo containerlab deploy --topo topo.clab.yml
    
    # OR for Docker Compose topologies
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access the lab and complete the steps** (Refer to the `README.md` inside the specific lab folder for details).

5.  **Destroy the lab when finished:**
    ```bash
    # For containerlab
    sudo containerlab destroy --topo topo.clab.yml

    # OR for Docker Compose
    docker-compose down
    ```
